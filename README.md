# LyricalPromise

A C# Promise library intended for use with Unity games. Developed primarily for my own amusement, functionality is limited.

Features
 * Promises can be chained
 * Chained Promises may resolve to different types

Missing Features
 * Rejecting Promises (and any kind of exception handling)
 * Static convenience methods e.g. Promise.Resolve(), Promise.All() etc.
